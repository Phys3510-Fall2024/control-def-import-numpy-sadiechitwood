    "# Assignment\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Show a clear understanding of how different symmetry operations affect physical quantiities such as scalars, vectors, and pseudoscalars, and an approach to implementing these operations using Python and `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symmetry \n",
    "Symmetry is a fundamental concept in physics. If a system obeys certain symmetries, the models we use to describe it must also obery those same symmetries. \n",
    "Everytime you write down an equation for the energy of a system, or the force acting on a systme, there has to be an implicit appeal to your innate understanding of symmetyr. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The 1D objects\n",
    "For this assignments, we are to define 'one-dimensional objects' with vector operations, and use special symmetries to make sense of them. The four we are going to explore are:\n",
    "1. scalar\n",
    "2. pseudoscalar\n",
    "3. polar vector\n",
    "4. axial (pseduo) vector\n",
